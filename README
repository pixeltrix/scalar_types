ScalarTypes
===========

This plugin provides value objects for modelling attributes 
such as length, area, volume and weight. Useful when used 
with ActiveRecord::Aggregations, e.g:

  composed_of :weight, :mapping => [ %w(weight_amount amount), %w(weight_units units)]

Where possible when value objects are multiplied together the appropriate
object is returned, e.g. length * length = area
